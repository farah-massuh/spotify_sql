# üéµ Spotify Data Analysis with PostgreSQL

This project is a comprehensive SQL-based data analysis of Spotify music streaming data. Using PostgreSQL, we set up a database from raw CSV data and answered a variety of business-relevant questions to gain insights into track performance, audience behavior, and platform trends.


## üåü Why This Project Is Important
This project showcases my ability to think like a Data Analyst by transforming raw Spotify data into structured insights using SQL and PostgreSQL. It demonstrates end-to-end analytical skills‚Äîfrom designing a database and writing meaningful queries to interpreting results and communicating insights clearly. By focusing on real-world business questions, the project highlights how data can support strategic decisions, making it a valuable piece in my data analytics portfolio.


## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: Provided via `spotify.csv` from [Sanjana Chaudhari](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset)
- **Contents**: Information on tracks, albums, artists, views, likes, comments, danceability, energy, and streaming platforms (Spotify vs YouTube).


## üîß Tools Used
- PostgreSQL: Used to create and manage the relational database
- VSCode: Main development environment for writing SQL scripts and managing files
- pgAdmin: GUI client for executing SQL queries, managing tables, and inspecting results


## üîÑ Database Setup
The database is set up in 3 steps:

1. `1_database_setup.sql` ‚Äì Creates the database.
2. `2_table_setup.sql` ‚Äì Defines tables and schemas.
3. `3_data_populate.sql` ‚Äì Loads data from the CSV into the tables.

All SQL files are located in `sql_files/schema/`.
