## üåü Why This Project Is Important
This project showcases my ability to think like a Data Analyst by transforming raw Spotify data into structured insights using PostgreSQL. It demonstrates end-to-end analytical skills‚Äîfrom designing a database and writing meaningful queries to interpreting results and communicating insights clearly. By focusing on real-world business questions, the project highlights how data can support strategic decisions, making it a valuable piece in my data analytics portfolio.


## üìä Dataset
- **Source**: Provided via `spotify.csv` from [Sanjana Chaudhari](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/spotify-dataset)
- **Contents**: Information on tracks, albums, artists, views, likes, comments, danceability, energy, and streaming platforms (Spotify vs YouTube).


## üîß Tools Used
- PostgreSQL: Used to create and manage the relational database
- VSCode: Main development environment for writing SQL scripts and managing files
- pgAdmin: GUI client for executing SQL queries, managing tables, and inspecting results
- ChatGPT: For query optimization and insight helper


## üîÑ Database Setup
The database is set up in 3 steps:

1. `1_database_setup.sql` ‚Äì Creates the database.
2. `2_table_setup.sql` ‚Äì Defines tables and schemas.
3. `3_data_populate.sql` ‚Äì Loads data from the CSV into the tables.

All SQL files are located in `sql_files/`.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Insights
- Global Popularity Revealed: Multiple tracks exceeded one billion streams on Spotify, indicating massive global reach and audience engagement.
- Licensing and Engagement Go Hand in Hand: Licensed tracks tend to receive more user interaction (e.g., comments), suggesting that official releases are more trusted and promoted.
- Prolific Artists Identified: Certain artists contribute significantly more tracks to the platform, offering a strategic opportunity for label-focused marketing and promotion.
- Energy & Danceability = Popularity: Tracks with higher energy and danceability scores are consistently among the most streamed and viewed, making them ideal for upbeat playlists and social media use.
- Visual Content Drives Performance: Tracks with official videos not only have more visibility but also outperform in terms of views and likes, emphasizing the value of multimedia promotion.
- YouTube vs Spotify Trends: Some tracks perform better on Spotify than on YouTube, suggesting platform-specific audience preferences that can inform targeted advertising.
- Album-Level Trends: Aggregated album data (e.g., total views, average danceability) reveals performance at a higher level and can guide production and curation decisions.
- Live-Feeling Tracks Stand Out: Tracks with above-average liveness may cater to niche audiences that prefer the feel of live performances.
- Wide Variability in Track Energy: The range between the highest and lowest energy scores shows that the dataset includes a diverse mix of moods and styles‚Äîideal for personalized playlists.
